# ai-afterlife-cards
A Thing from the Future's Past -- A card game used in the AI + Afterlife workshops.

A series of workshops were conducted during 2024 exploring design futures at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and the Afterlife.

The workshop made use of a game developed specifically for these workshops. The repository includes:
* **Website** to let people draw cards from the deck. It was originally constructed on glitch.me, but it can be downloaded here and run locally on in a browser.
* Other resources will be added here as they are developed.
